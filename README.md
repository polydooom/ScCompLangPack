# ⚙️ Component Language Pack

This language pack modifies component names to make it easier to detect and track stats.

For example:

`XL-1` → `XL-1 Military A`

---
[Alternate Version](https://github.com/joeydee1986/ScCompLangPackRemix):

`XL-1` → `M2A XL-1` (Included in the altremix folder for convenient access to update each patch)
